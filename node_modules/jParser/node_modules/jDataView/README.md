================================

jDataView provides a standard way to read and/or modify binary files in all the browsers. It follows the [DataView Specification](http://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/doc/spec/TypedArray-spec.html#6) and even extends it for a more practical use.

Caution
=========

According to new npm naming restrictions, jDataView was renamed to jdataview in registry and this package is left only for backward compatibility.

Refer to [new package](https://npmjs.org/package/jdataview) for up-to-date version of code and documentation.
